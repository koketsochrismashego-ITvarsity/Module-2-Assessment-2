                           <p><i><b>Diesel is an innovative international lifestyle company, producing a wide-ranging collection of jeans, clothing and accessories. Since its creation in 1978, Diesel has experienced extraordinary growth and has evolved from being a leading pioneer in denim into the world of premium casual wear, becoming a true alternative to the established luxury market. Dieselâ€™s philosophy has remained the same as the day of its creation: Renzo Rosso had envisaged a brand that would stand for passion, individuality and self-expression. Diesel thrives on change: it produces no less than 3,000 new products every season and each one derives from a process of enormous creative freedom, ensuring constant innovation.</b></i></p>
